# Nipah Virus Evolutionary Analysis

Summer project at <a href="https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/program/ecohealthnet" target="_blank">EcoHealthNet</a>

## Project Goals

## Workflow

Reference Nipah virus genomes (used coding DNA sequences only):

<ul>
  <li>Malaysian strain: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_002728.1" target="_blank">NC_002728.1</a></li>
  <li>Bangladeshi strain: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AY988601.1" target="_blank">AY988601.1</a></li>
</ul>

79 glycoprotein and 79 phosphoprotein sequences were extracted using BLAST. 76 of these are from the same isolates.

### Deduplication

After deduplication of the sequences, 46 glycoprotein (58%) and 50 phosphoprotein (63%) sequences remained.
