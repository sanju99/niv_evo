Host:    compute-e-16-229.o2.rc.hms.harvard.edu (AVX2, FMA3, 251 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree -s seq_for_analysis/P_no_stop_codons.fasta -m MFP -o 1000 -czb -redo
Seed:    479565 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Sat Aug  6 17:43:29 2022
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (2 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 2 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.
